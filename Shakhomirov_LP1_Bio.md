With over twenty years of experience in data analytics, corporate banking risk units, and digital marketing, I have obtained considerable expertise in risk management, data engineering and mathematical modelling, statistical analysis, business administration, and marketing.

After having completed my MBA at Newcastle I worked with numerous start up companies in the UK in building BI systems, designing data pipelines, machine learning models and implementing genetic algorithms. These roles allowed me to apply combined marketing and data handling skills and I feel that a career in data driven marketing or computer science and artificial intelligence is definitely something I would like to pursue. These are engaging and interesting fields that allow the practical application of data science in an extremely rewarding way, as well as room for continuing professional development, innovation, implementing novel ideas and contributing to a constantly evolving field.
